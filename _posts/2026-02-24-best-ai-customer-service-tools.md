## Building AI Support with ChatGPT API

For businesses wanting custom AI support, the ChatGPT API offers maximum flexibility.

**Basic architecture:**
1. Feed your FAQ, docs, and past tickets into a knowledge base
2. Use embeddings to find relevant information for each query
3. ChatGPT generates responses based on your knowledge base
4. Add guardrails (don't make promises, escalate complex issues)
5. Human review for edge cases

**When to build custom vs. buy:**
- **Buy** (Intercom, Zendesk): You want it working today, standard support workflows
- **Build** (ChatGPT API): You need deep customization, unique workflows, or integration with proprietary systems

## AI Customer Service Metrics

Track these to measure AI support effectiveness:

| Metric | Target | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| AI Resolution Rate | 40-60% | % of tickets resolved without humans |
| First Response Time | < 30 seconds | How fast AI responds |
| CSAT (AI) | > 85% | Customer satisfaction with AI responses |
| Escalation Rate | < 40% | % of conversations needing humans |
| Cost per Resolution | < $2 | AI vs. human cost comparison |
| Containment Rate | > 50% | % of issues fully handled by AI |

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start with FAQ automation** — handle the easy 50% first
2. **Train on real conversations** — use your actual support history
3. **Set clear escalation rules** — AI should know when to hand off
4. **Monitor and improve weekly** — review AI responses for accuracy
5. **Be transparent** — tell customers they're talking to AI
6. **Keep human agents for complex issues** — AI handles volume, humans handle nuance

## Bottom Line

AI customer service tools pay for themselves quickly. A tool like Intercom Fin at $0.99 per resolution vs. $5-15 for human resolution means ROI within the first month.

For most businesses, start with Freshdesk (free tier) or Tidio (free tier) to test AI support. As volume grows, Intercom Fin or Zendesk AI provide enterprise-grade automation.

The goal isn't to eliminate human support — it's to let AI handle the repetitive questions so your team can focus on complex issues that actually need a human touch.
