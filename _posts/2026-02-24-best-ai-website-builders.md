- Advanced e-commerce setups
- Custom integrations

## Choosing the Right Builder

- **Want WordPress?** → 10Web
- **Design perfectionist?** → Squarespace

## Tips for AI-Generated Websites

1. **Customize the copy** — AI-generated text is generic. Add your voice, story, and specific details.
2. **Replace stock images** — use your own photos where possible. Authenticity matters.
3. **Check mobile view** — always preview on mobile before publishing.
4. **Set up analytics** — add Google Analytics from day one.
5. **SEO basics** — customize page titles, meta descriptions, and image alt text.
6. **Speed test** — run your site through Google PageSpeed Insights.

## Bottom Line

AI website builders have eliminated the need for web developers for most small business websites. You can go from zero to a professional website in under an hour.

Wix AI is the safest all-around choice. Framer wins on design quality. Durable is unbeatable for speed. And Hostinger offers the best value at $3/month.

Start with the free tiers, customize until you're happy, then upgrade when you're ready to connect a custom domain.
