## Using ChatGPT for Recruiting

**Write job descriptions:**
```
"Write a job description for a Senior Product Manager at a 
B2B SaaS startup. Include: role summary, responsibilities (8), 
requirements (6), nice-to-haves (4), and benefits. 
Use inclusive language. Avoid jargon and unnecessary requirements."
```

**Screen resumes:**
```
"I'm hiring for [role]. Here are the key requirements: [list].
Review this resume and rate the candidate on a scale of 1-10 
for each requirement. Identify strengths, gaps, and 
suggested interview questions based on their experience."
```

**Interview questions:**
```
"Generate 10 behavioral interview questions for a 
[role] position. Use the STAR format. Include questions 
about: leadership, problem-solving, collaboration, 
and handling failure. Mix difficulty levels."
```

## AI in HR Beyond Recruiting

- **Onboarding:** AI chatbots answer new hire questions, automate paperwork
- **Performance reviews:** AI drafts review summaries from feedback data
- **Employee engagement:** AI surveys analyze sentiment and predict turnover
- **Learning & development:** AI recommends training based on skill gaps
- **Compensation:** AI benchmarks salaries against market data

## Ethical Considerations

AI in hiring raises important concerns:

1. **Bias** — AI can perpetuate existing biases in training data
2. **Transparency** — candidates should know when AI is involved
3. **Privacy** — handle candidate data responsibly
4. **Human oversight** — AI should assist decisions, not make them alone
5. **Compliance** — some jurisdictions regulate AI in hiring (NYC, EU)

## Bottom Line

AI recruiting tools save HR teams hundreds of hours per year on repetitive tasks — screening resumes, scheduling interviews, and sourcing candidates. This lets recruiters focus on what matters: building relationships and making great hires.

For small teams, Manatal ($15/month) offers the best value. For high-volume hiring, Paradox's conversational AI is a game-changer. And ChatGPT (free) handles job descriptions and interview prep surprisingly well.
