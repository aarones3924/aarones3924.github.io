## How AI Improves Project Management

### Task Creation & Planning
Before AI: Manually break down projects into tasks, estimate timelines, assign team members.
With AI: Describe the project, AI generates the task breakdown, suggests timelines based on historical data, and recommends assignments based on team capacity.

### Status Reporting
Before AI: Spend 30 minutes every week compiling updates from team members.
With AI: AI automatically generates status reports from task progress, comments, and completed work.

### Meeting Follow-ups
Before AI: Take notes, manually create action items, assign tasks.
With AI: AI transcribes the meeting, extracts action items, creates tasks, and assigns them to the right people.

### Risk Management
Before AI: Manually track deadlines and hope nothing slips.
With AI: AI monitors project health, predicts delays before they happen, and suggests corrective actions.

## Choosing the Right Tool

For most teams, Notion AI or ClickUp AI offers the best balance of features and value. For software teams, Linear is hard to beat. And if you want the most AI-native experience, Taskade is pushing the boundaries of what AI can do in project management.
