def calculate_investment(principal, rate, years, monthly):
    # AI will complete this better with the comment
```

### 2. Accept Suggestions Selectively
Don't accept everything. Review suggestions for:
- Security issues
- Performance problems
- Code style consistency

### 3. Use Chat for Complex Tasks
Autocomplete is great for simple code. Use chat for:
- Debugging
- Architecture decisions\ new concepts

### 4. Provide Context
The more context AI has, the better suggestions you get:
- Keep related files open
- Use descriptive variable names
- Include type hints

## Common Concerns
