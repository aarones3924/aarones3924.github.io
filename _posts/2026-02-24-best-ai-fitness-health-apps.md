### ChatGPT for Nutrition Plans

```
"Create a 7-day meal plan for:
- Goal: lose 1 lb/week
- Calories: 1,800/day
- Macros: 40% protein, 30% carbs, 30% fat
- Dietary restrictions: no dairy
- Cooking skill: intermediate
- Prep time: max 30 minutes per meal
Include a grocery list organized by store section."
```

## Using ChatGPT as a Fitness Coach

ChatGPT can create surprisingly good workout and nutrition plans when given the right context.

**Workout plan prompt:**
```
"Create a 4-day/week strength training program for:
- Goal: build muscle (hypertrophy)
- Experience: intermediate (2 years lifting)
- Equipment: full gym
- Time: 60 minutes per session
- Split: upper/lower
Include: exercises, sets, reps, rest periods, and 
progressive overload strategy for 8 weeks."
```

**Running plan prompt:**
```
"Create an 8-week 5K training plan for a beginner runner.
Current fitness: can jog 1 mile without stopping.
Available days: 4 per week.
Include: easy runs, intervals, rest days, and a taper week.
Add pacing guidelines for each workout."
```

**Limitations:** ChatGPT can't see your form, doesn't know your injury history, and can't adjust in real-time. Use it for planning, not as a replacement for professional guidance on complex issues.

## Choosing the Right Setup

**Beginner on a budget:**
- Freeletics Free (workouts) + MyFitnessPal Free (nutrition)
- Total cost: $0

**Serious gym-goer:**
- Fitbod ($13/mo) + MyFitnessPal Premium ($20/mo)
- Total cost: $33/month

**Data-driven athlete:**
- WHOOP ($30/mo) + Fitbod ($13/mo) + Oura Ring ($6/mo)
- Total cost: $49/month

**Home workout enthusiast:**
- Tempo ($40/mo) or Freeletics ($10/mo)
- Total cost: $10-$40/month

## Bottom Line

AI fitness tools make personalized training accessible to everyone. You don't need a $100/session personal trainer to get a customized workout plan that adapts to your progress.

Start with Fitbod (free tier) for strength training or Freeletics (free) for bodyweight workouts. Add nutrition tracking with MyFitnessPal. As you get more serious, wearables like WHOOP and Oura Ring provide data-driven insights that optimize your training and recovery.

The best fitness app is the one you'll actually use consistently. Try a few free tiers and stick with what fits your lifestyle.
