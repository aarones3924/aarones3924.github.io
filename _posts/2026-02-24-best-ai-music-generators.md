## Copyright & Legal Considerations

This is the big question with AI music:

- **Suno/Udio:** You own the output on paid plans. Free tier has restrictions.
- **AIVA:** Free tier — AIVA owns copyright. Paid — you own it.
- **Soundraw:** Full commercial license included.
- **Boomy:** You can distribute and earn royalties.

**Important notes:**
- AI-generated music copyright law is still evolving
- Some platforms may flag AI music
- Always check the specific tool's license terms
- Don't claim AI music was human-made if asked

## Tips for Better AI Music

1. **Be specific with prompts** — "melancholic piano ballad in C minor, slow tempo, female vocals" beats "sad song"
2. **Generate multiple versions** — AI output varies; create 5-10 versions and pick the best
3. **Use reference descriptions** — "sounds like Radiohead meets Billie Eilish" gives AI a clear direction
4. **Edit and combine** — use the best parts from different generations
5. **Layer with real instruments** — AI music + human touches = professional quality

## Bottom Line

AI music generation in 2026 is genuinely impressive. Suno and Udio produce songs that could pass for human-made in many cases. For content creators, these tools eliminate the need for expensive music licensing or production.

Start with Suno (free tier is generous) to experience what's possible. For commercial use, Soundraw's royalty-free model is the safest bet. And for serious music production, AIVA's MIDI export lets you use AI as a starting point and refine in professional tools.
