|---------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Best For | Complex reasoning | Analysis & writing | Multimodal tasks |
| Reasoning | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Math | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Coding | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Writing | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Context Window | 200K | 200K | 1M+ |
| Speed | Slow (thinking) | Medium | Fast |
| Price | $200/mo (Pro) | $20/mo (Pro) | $20/mo (Advanced) |

## What Are Reasoning Models?

Traditional AI models generate text word by word. Reasoning models like o3 "think" before answering — they break problems into steps, consider multiple approaches, and verify their work. This makes them dramatically better at complex tasks.

**How reasoning works:**
1. Model receives your question
2. Internal chain-of-thought reasoning (you may see "thinking...")
3. Explores multiple solution paths
4. Verifies the answer
5. Delivers a well-reasoned response

The tradeoff: reasoning models are slower and more expensive, but significantly more accurate on hard problems.

## Head-to-Head Tests

### Test 1: Advanced Mathematics

**Problem:** Solve a multi-step optimization problem involving calculus, linear algebra, and probability.

**o3:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Flawless. Showed complete chain-of-thought, identified the optimal approach immediately, and verified the answer. Caught a subtle edge case the others missed.

**Claude Opus:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Correct answer with thorough explanation. Took a slightly longer path to the solution but got there. Missed the edge case.

**Gemini Ultra:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Correct answer but skipped some intermediate steps. Explanation was less detailed.

**Winner: o3** — Purpose-built for mathematical reasoning.

### Test 2: Complex Coding Challenge

**Task:** Implement a concurrent web crawler with rate limiting, retry logic, and deduplication in Go.

**o3:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Clean, idiomatic Go code. Proper goroutine management, channel usage, and error handling. Production-ready.

**Claude Opus:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Equally excellent code with more detailed comments. Included test cases without being asked. Slightly more defensive coding style.

**Gemini Ultra:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Good code but less idiomatic. Some unnecessary complexity. Functional but not as clean.

**Winner: Tie (o3 & Claude Opus)** — Both produce excellent code.

### Test 3: Logical Reasoning

**Problem:** A complex logic puzzle involving multiple constraints, deduction, and elimination.

**o3:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Solved it systematically. Showed each deduction step clearly. Identified all constraints and resolved them in optimal order.

**Claude Opus:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Correct solution but took more steps. Occasionally explored dead ends before backtracking. Still got the right answer.

**Gemini Ultra:** ⭐⭐⭐ — Made an error in the middle of the reasoning chain that led to a wrong conclusion. Self-corrected when asked to verify.

**Winner: o3** — Reasoning is literally what it's built for.

### Test 4: Long Document Analysis

**Task:** Analyze a 100-page legal document, identify key risks, and summarize implications.

**o3:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Good analysis but limited by 200K context. Had to process in chunks for very long documents.

**Claude Opus:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Excellent analysis with nuanced understanding. 200K context handled the document well. Caught subtle implications others missed.

**Gemini Ultra:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — The 1M+ context window means it processed the entire document at once. Comprehensive analysis with cross-references between sections.

**Winner: Gemini Ultra** — Context window advantage is real for long documents.

### Test 5: Creative Problem Solving

**Task:** Design a novel solution for urban food waste reduction that combines technology, behavioral economics, and community engagement.

**o3:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Structured, logical approach. Good technical solutions but less creative. Felt more like an engineering proposal.

**Claude Opus:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Most creative and holistic solution. Combined technical, social, and economic elements beautifully. Considered second-order effects and potential failures.

**Gemini Ultra:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Good solution with strong data-backed reasoning. Referenced real-world examples effectively.

**Winner: Claude Opus** — Best at nuanced, creative thinking.

## When to Use Each

### Choose o3 When:
- Solving complex math or science problems
- Tasks requiring multi-step logical reasoning
- Competitive programming challenges
- Formal verification or proof-checking
- You need the highest accuracy on hard problems
- You're willing to wait (and pay) for the best reasoning

### Choose Claude Opus When:
- Analyzing long, complex documents
- Creative problem-solving and strategy
- Writing that requires nuance and depth
- Tasks needing careful ethical consideration
- You want thorough, well-explained answers
- Best balance of reasoning + writing quality

### Choose Gemini Ultra When:
- Processing very long documents (1M+ tokens)
- Multimodal tasks (text + images + video)
- Tasks requiring real-time information
- Google Workspace integration
- You need speed over maximum reasoning depth

## Pricing Reality Check

| Model | Access | Monthly Cost |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| o3 | ChatGPT Pro | $200/month |
| o3-mini | ChatGPT Plus | $20/month |
| Claude Opus | Claude Pro | $20/month |
| Gemini Ultra | Gemini Advanced | $20/month |

**The value question:** Is o3 at $200/month worth 10x the price of Claude Opus or Gemini Ultra? For most people, no. o3-mini at $20/month offers 80% of the reasoning capability at 10% of the price.

## The Smart Strategy

Use the right model for each task:

- **Hard math/logic** → o3 or o3-mini
- **Writing & analysis** → Claude Opus
- **Long documents** → Gemini Ultra (1M context)
- **Quick tasks** → Any model (they're all good at easy stuff)
- **Coding** → o3 or Claude Opus (both excellent)
- **Research** → Gemini Ultra (Google Search integration)

## Bottom Line

All three models are remarkably capable. The differences show up on hard problems — easy tasks are handled well by any of them.

For most people, Claude Opus or Gemini Ultra at $20/month offers the best value. o3 is the reasoning king but at 10x the price, it's only worth it for professionals who regularly tackle complex mathematical or logical problems.

The AI reasoning race is far from over. Each model update narrows the gaps, and today's rankings may shift with the next release.
