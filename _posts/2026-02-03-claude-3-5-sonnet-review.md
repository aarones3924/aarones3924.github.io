# Claude 3.5 Sonnet Review: The GPT-4 Killer?

Anthropic's Claude has quietly become one of the best AI assistants available. After months of daily use, here's my honest review of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

## What is Claude?

Claude is an AI assistant made by Anthropic, a company founded by former OpenAI researchers. It's designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest.

The current lineup:
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Best balance of speed and intelligence
- **Claude 3 Opus** - Most capable, slower
- **Claude 3 Haiku** - Fastest, for simple tasks

## Key Features

### 200K Context Window

Claude can process about 150,000 words at once. That's an entire book. This makes it excellent for:
- Analyzing long documents
- Coding large projects
- Research and summarization

### Artifacts

Claude can create interactive content directly in chat:
- Code that runs in browser
- Charts and visualizations
- Documents and diagrams
- Simple web apps

### Computer Use (Beta)

Claude can control your computer to complete tasks. It's still experimental but shows where AI is heading.

### Projects

Organize conversations with custom instructions and uploaded files. Great for ongoing work.

## What Claude Does Best

### 1. Writing

Claude produces natural, well-structured writing. It's particularly good at:
- Long-form content
- Technical documentation
- Creative writing
- Editing and feedback

The writing feels less robotic than GPT-4, with better flow and structure.

### 2. Coding

Claude excels at programming tasks:
- Understands complex codebases
- Writes clean, documented code
- Great at debugging
- Explains concepts clearly

The 200K context window means it can work with entire projects at once.

### 3. Analysis

Give Claude a document and it will:
- Summarize key points
- Extract specific information
- Identify patterns
- Answer questions about content

### 4. Reasoning

Claude handles complex reasoning well:
- Multi-step problems
- Logical analysis
- Weighing pros and cons
- Strategic thinking

## Claude vs GPT-4

| Feature | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | GPT-4 |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Context window | 200K tokens | 128K tokens |
| Speed | Fast | Medium |
| Writing quality | Excellent | Very good |
| Coding | Excellent | Excellent |
| Image understanding | Yes | Yes |
| Image generation | No | Yes (DALL-E) |
| Web browsing | No | Yes |
| Price | $20/mo | $20/mo |

**When to choose Claude:**
- Long document analysis
- Writing tasks
- Coding projects
- When you want less "AI-sounding" output

**When to choose GPT-4:**
- Need image generation
- Want web browsing
- Prefer the ChatGPT ecosystem
- Need plugins/GPTs

## Pricing

### Free Tier
- Limited messages per day
- Access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Basic features

### Claude Pro ($20/month)
- 5x more usage
- Priority access
- Early access to new features
- Projects feature

### API Pricing
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: $3 input / $15 output per million tokens
- Claude 3 Opus: $15 input / $75 output per million tokens
- Claude 3 Haiku: $0.25 input / $1.25 output per million tokens

## Limitations

### No Image Generation
Claude can't create images. You'll need Midjourney, DALL-E, or similar tools.

### No Web Browsing
Claude can't search the internet. Its knowledge has a cutoff date.

### No Plugins
Unlike ChatGPT, Claude doesn't have a plugin ecosystem.

### Usage Limits
Even Pro users hit limits during peak times. Can be frustrating for heavy users.

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific** - Claude follows instructions well, so be detailed
2. **Use system prompts** - Set context at the start of conversations
3. **Upload files** - Claude handles documents better than copy-pasting
4. **Use Projects** - Keep related work organized
5. **Ask for formats** - Request markdown, JSON, or specific structures

## Real-World Use Cases

### Content Creation
I use Claude for:
- Blog post drafts
- Email writing
- Social media content
- Documentation

### Development
- Code review
- Bug fixing
- Writing tests
- Architecture discussions

### Research
- Summarizing papers
- Comparing options
- Fact extraction
- Literature review

## Who Should Use Claude?

**Best for:**
- Writers and content creators
- Developers
- Researchers
- Anyone w long documents

**Maybe not for:**
- Users who need image generation
- Those who rely on web browsing
- Plugin/integration heavy workflows

## Verdict

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is genuinely excellent. It's my daily driver for writing and coding tasks. The 200K context window is a game-changer for working with large documents.

**Rating: 9/10**

The only things holding it back are the lack of image generation and web browsing. For pure text tasks, it's arguably the best AI assistant available.
