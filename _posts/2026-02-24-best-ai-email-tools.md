not pushy. Suggest a quick call."

personalized, with a clear CTA."
```

Be firm but professional. Request a new timeline and 
ask what happened without being accusatory."

product manager role. Reference our discussion about 
the product roadmap. Express enthusiasm without being

## Email Productivity Tips with AI

1. **Batch process emails** — set 2-3 times per day for email, use AI to speed through replies
2. **Use AI for first drafts** — let AI write, then add your personal touch
3. **Summarize before reading** — use AI summaries to decide which threads need attention
4. **Template common responses** — save AI-generated templates for recurring situations
5. **Unsubscribe aggressively** — use Sanebox or manual unsubscribe to reduce volume
6. **Set response expectations** — not every email needs an immediate reply

## Bottom Line

AI email tools save the average professional 5-10 hours per week. That's a full workday back.

For Gmail users, start with the built-in Gemini features (free). If you want the premium experience, Superhuman is worth the $30/month for heavy email users. For inbox management, Sanebox is a game-changer at just $7/month.

The goal isn't to automate all your communication — it's to spend less time on routine emails so you can give more attention to the ones that matter.
