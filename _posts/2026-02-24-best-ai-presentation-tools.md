## How to Get the Best Results from AI Presentations

1. **Be specific with your prompt** — "10-slide pitch deck for a SaaS startup targeting small businesses" beats "make a presentation"
2. **Provide your content** — AI works better when you paste your notes or outline rather than generating from scratch
3. **Always edit the output** — AI gets you 80% there; the last 20% is your expertise
4. **Match the tool to the audience** — Gamma for quick internal decks, Beautiful.ai for client-facing, Tome for creative pitches
5. **Export and customize** — Most tools let you export to PowerPoint for final tweaks

## Bottom Line

AI presentation tools have reached a point where there's no reason to spend hours on slide design. Gamma is our top pick for most people — it's free to start, produces great results, and exports to PowerPoint.

For business teams, Beautiful.ai's brand consistency features are worth the investment. For creative work, Tome's storytelling approach stands out.
