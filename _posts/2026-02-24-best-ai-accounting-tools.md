"Analyze these quarterly financials and identify:

2. Margin changes
3. Concerning expense categories
4. Cash flow health
5. Key ratios (current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-equity)
[paste financial data]"
```

**Tax planning:**
```
"I'm a freelancer earning $80,000/year in the US. 
What tax deductions should I be tracking? 
Create a checklist of common deductions for 
self-employed individuals."
```

**Budget creation:**
```
"Create a monthly budget template for a small 
e-commerce business with $50,000/month revenue. 
Include categories for: COGS, marketing, software, 
shipping, payroll, and overhead. 
Suggest healthy percentage ranges for each category."
```

> **Important:** ChatGPT is not a tax advisor. Always verify tax-related information with a qualified accountant.

## AI Accounting Workflow

## Bottom Line

AI accounting tools turn hours of bookkeeping into minutes of review. For most small businesses, QuickBooks or Xero with their built-in AI features handle everything you need.

The key is letting AI do the repetitive work (categorization, data entry, reconciliation) while you focus on the strategic decisions (pricing, spending, growth).
