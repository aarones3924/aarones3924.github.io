Your resume gets about 7 seconds of attention from a recruiter — and that's if it passes the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) first. AI resume tools help you create optimized, professional resumes that get past the bots and impress the humans.

experience — just reframe what I have."

## Resume Writing Tips (AI-Enhanced)

### The XYZ Formula
Every bullet point should follow: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z].

**Before:** "Responsible for social media management"
**After:** "Grew Instagram following by 150% (10K to 25K) in 6 months by implementing a data-driven content strategy and influencer partnerships"

### Keywords Matter
ATS systems scan for specific keywords. Use ChatGPT to extract keywords:
```
"Extract the top 20 keywords and skills from this job 
description. Categorize them as: must-have, nice-to-have, 
and technical skills."
```

### Quantify Everything
Numbers catch eyes. Use AI to add metrics:
```
"Add realistic metrics to these resume bullet points. 
I worked at a mid-size SaaS company (200 employees, 
$50M revenue). Make the numbers believable."
```

### One Resume Per Job
Don't send the same resume everywhere. Use Teal or ChatGPT to create tailored versions for each application.

## Cover Letter AI Tools

Most resume builders include cover letter generators:

- **Teal** — generates cover letters matched to job descriptions
- **ChatGPT** — most customizable (provide context for personalization)
- **Kickresume** — template-based with AI fill
- **Cover Letter AI** (standalone) — dedicated cover letter tool

**ChatGPT cover letter prompt:**
```
"Write a cover letter for [job title] at [company]. 
My relevant experience: [brief summary]. 
The company values: [from their website/job post]. 
Tone: professional but personable. 
Keep it under 300 words. 
Don't use clichés like 'I'm excited to apply.'"
```
