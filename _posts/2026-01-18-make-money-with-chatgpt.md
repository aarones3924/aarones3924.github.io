## Common Mistakes

### 1. Selling "AI Content"
❌ Marketing yourself as an AI content creator
✅ Marketing yourself as a fast, quality content creator

Clients want results, not to know your tools.

### 2. No Quality Control
❌ Sending AI output directly to clients
✅ Always editing, fact-checking, and improving

AI output is a draft, not a deliverable.

### 3. Racing to the Bottom
❌ Competing on price with other AI users
✅ Competing on quality, speed, and reliability

Anyone can use ChatGPT. Few use it well.

### 4. Ignoring Fundamentals
❌ Thinking AI replaces skill
✅ Using AI to amplify existing skills

Learn the craft. AI makes good writers better, not non-writers good.

### 5. Expecive Income
❌ "Set up AI and money flows in"
✅ AI makes active work more efficient

True passive income requires significant upfront investment.
