## Best AI Tools for Teachers

Beyond ChatGPT, these tools are specifically designed for educators:

- **MagicSchool.ai** — AI built specifically for teachers (lesson plans, assessments, IEP drafts)
- **Curipod** — AI-generated interactive lessons and slides
- **Diffit** — Differentiated reading materials at any level
- **Brisk Teaching** — Chrome extension for grading and feedback
- **SchoolAI** — AI chatbot spaces for student use (teacher-monitored)
- **Canva for Education** — Free design tools with AI for teachers

## Tips for Using AI Responsibly in Education

1. **Always review AI output** — check for accuracy, bias, and age-appropriateness
2. **Customize for your students** — AI gives you a starting point; adapt it to your class
3. **Be transparent** — let students know when AI-assisted materials are used
4. **Teach AI literacy** — help students understand what AI can and can't do
5. **Protect student privacy** — never input student names or personal data into AI tools
6. **Save your best prompts** — build a personal prompt library for recurring tasks

## Bottom Line

AI won't replace teachers — but teachers who use AI will have more time for what matters most: connecting with students, providing individualized support, and bringing creativity to the classroom.

Start with one or two use cases that save you the most time (lesson planning and quiz creation are the biggest wins), then expand from there. The goal isn't to automate teaching — it's to automate the paperwork so you can focus on the teaching.
