## Tips for Designers Using AI

1. **Use AI for the first 80%, refine the last 20% manually** — AI gets you close, your expertise makes it perfect
2. **Build a prompt library** — save prompts that produce good results for reuse
3. **Combine tools** — Midjourney for concepts → Photoshop for refinement → Figma for implementation
4. **Stay in control** — AI is a tool, not a replacement for design thinking
5. **Learn prompt engineering** — better prompts = better results = less manual work

## Bottom Line

AI tools are making designers more productive, not obsolete. The designers who embrace AI will outpace those who don't — not because AI does better design, but because it handles the tedious parts so you can focus on creative decisions.

Start with Canva AI if you're a beginner, Adobe Firefly if you're a pro, and Midjourney if you need creative inspiration. The best approach is to experiment with several tools and find what fits your workflow.
