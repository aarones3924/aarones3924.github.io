ChatGPT has become the most popular AI tool in the world. But are you using it to its full potential?

This guide covers everything from signing up to advanced prompting techniques.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. It can:
- Answer questions
- Write content (emails, essays, code)
- Brainstorm ideas
- Analyze data
- And much more

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create an Account

1. Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Use email, Google, or Microsoft account
4. Verify your email
5. Done!

### Step 2: Choose Your Plan

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | $0 | GPT-3.5, basic features |
| Plus | $20/mo | GPT-4, faster responses, plugins |
| Team | $25/user/mo | Workspace features, admin controls |

**Recommendation:** Start with Free, upgrade to Plus if you use it daily.

## How to Write Good Prompts

The quality of ChatGPT's output depends on your input. Here's how to write better prompts:

### 1. Be Specific

❌ Bad: "Write about dogs"

✅ Good: "Write a 500-word blog post about the top 5 dog breeds for apartment living, including pros and cons of each"

### 2. Provide Context

❌ Bad: "Fix this code"

✅ Good: "I'm building a React app. This component should fetch user data on mount, but it's causing an infinite loop. Here's the code: [code]. What's wrong?"

### 3. Specify Format

❌ Bad: "Give me marketing ideas"

✅ Good: "Give me 10 marketing ideas for a SaaS startup. Format as a numbered list with a one-sentence description for each"

### 4. Use Role-Playing

✅ "Act as a senior software engineer. Review this code and suggest improvements focusing on performance and readability"

✅ "You are a marketing expert. Create a launch strategy for a new fitness app targeting millennials"

## Advanced Features

3. Fill in:
   - What you want ChatGPT to know about you

- "I'm a software developer working with Python and React"
- "Keep responses concise. Use code examples when relevant. Avoid unnecessary explanations"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Trusting Everything
ChatGPT can be wrong. Always verify important facts.

### 2. One-Shot Prompting
Don't expect perfection on the first try. Iterate and refine.

### 3. Ignoring Context Length
ChatGPT has a memory limit. For long conversations, summarize periodically.

### 4. Not Using System Prompts
In the API, system prompts set behavior. In chat, use Custom Instructions.

## Tips for Power Users

1. **Use markdown** — ChatGPT understands and formats markdown
2. **Chain prompts** — Break complex tasks into steps
3. **Ask for alternatives** — "Give me 3 different approaches"
4. **Request explanations** — "Explain your reasoning"
5. **Set constraints** — "In under 100 words" or "Using only Python standard library"

## Conclusion

ChatGPT is incredibly powerful, but it's a tool — the results depend on how you use it.

Start with simple tasks, experiment with prompts, and gplore advanced features. The more you practice, the better your results will be.
