## Calendar Productivity Tips

1. **Block focus time first** — schedule deep work before meetings fill your calendar
2. **Use buffer time** — 15 minutes between meetings prevents back-to-back burnout
3. **Set meeting defaults to 25 or 50 minutes** — not every meeting needs a full hour
4. **Batch meetings** — cluster meetings on specific days to protect focus days
5. **Share booking links** — stop the "when are you free?" email chains
6. **Review weekly** — spend 10 minutes Sunday planning the week ahead

## Bottom Line

AI scheduling tools give you back hours every week by eliminating scheduling friction and protecting your productive time.

For individuals, Reclaim.ai (free) is the best starting point — it automatically protects your focus time and schedules tasks intelligently. For teams, Clockwise optimizes everyone's calendars together. For booking meetings with external people, Calendly remains the simplest solution.
