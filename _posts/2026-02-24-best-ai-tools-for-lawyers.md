### ChatGPT for Legal Work

ChatGPT is useful for many legal tasks, but with important caveats.

**Good for:**
```
"Explain the key differences between LLC and S-Corp 
for a small business owner. Use plain English."

"Draft a basic NDA between two companies for a 
potential partnership discussion. Include standard 
terms for confidentiality period, exclusions, and remedies."

"Summarize the key provisions of GDPR Article 17 
(Right to Erasure) and list the exceptions."

"Create a checklist for due diligence in a small 
business acquisition ($1-5M range)."
```

**Not good for:**
- Citing specific cases (may hallucinate citations)
- Jurisdiction-specific advice
- Replacing actual legal counsel
- Anything where accuracy is critical without verification

**Rule:** Use ChatGPT for first drafts and general understanding. Always verify with proper legal research tools and professional judgment.

**What it can do:**
- Fight parking tickets
- Cancel subscriptions
- Claim airline compensation
- Draft demand letters
- File small claims court paperwork
- DMCA takedown notices
- Privacy data deletion requests

**Price:** $3/month

## AI Legal Ethics

Important considerations for lawyers using AI:

1. **Duty of competence** — understand the AI tool's limitations
2. **Confidentiality** — ensure client data isn't used for AI training
3. **Verify everything** — AI can hallucinate cases and citations
4. **Disclose AI use** — some jurisdictions require disclosure
5. **Supervise AI output** — a lawyer must review all AI-generated work
6. **Stay current** — AI legal ethics rules are evolving rapidly

## How AI Changes Legal Work

| Task | Before AI | With AI | Time Saved |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Contract review | 2-4 hours | 15-30 min | 85% |
| Legal research | 4-8 hours | 30-60 min | 90% |
| Document drafting | 2-3 hours | 30 min | 80% |
| Due diligence | Days-weeks | Hours | 75% |
| Case summarization | 1-2 hours | 5 min | 95% |

## Bottom Line

AI is transforming legal work by handling the time-intensive research, review, and drafting tasks. This doesn't replace lawyers — it makes them more efficient and allows them to focus on strategy, judgment, and client relationships.

For solo practitioners and small firms, Casetext ($65/month) and Spellbook ($100/month) offer the best value. For larger firms, Harvey AI and CoCounsel provide enterprise-grade capabilities. And for everyday legal tasks, ChatGPT is a useful (but imperfect) starting point.

The lawyers who embrace AI will handle more cases, serve clients better, and spend less time on tedious document work. The key is using AI as a powerful assistant while maintaining professional judgment and ethical standards.
