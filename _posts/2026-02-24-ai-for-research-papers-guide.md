## Stage 1: Finding Your Topic & Research Questions

### Perplexity AI — Your Research Starting Point

Perplexity is the best tool for initial research exploration. Unlike ChatGPT, every answer comes with cited sources.

**How to use it:**
1. Start with a broad question: "What are the current debates in [your field]?"
2. Use follow-up questions to narrow down
3. Switch to Academic mode for peer-reviewed sources only
4. Save interesting threads for later reference

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "What are the main challenges in renewable energy storage?"
Perplexity: [Detailed answer with 8 cited sources]
You: "Which of these challenges has the most recent research?"
Perplexity: [Narrowed answer with recent papers]
You: "What are the gaps in solid-state battery research?"
Perplexity: [Specific research gaps with citations]
```

Now you have a focused topic with initial sources.

### ChatGPT — Brainstorming Research Questions

Use ChatGPT to refine your research questions:

```
Prompt: "I'm writing a research paper on [topic]. Help me develop 
5 specific, researchable questions. They should be:
- Narrow enough for a 5000-word paper
- Addressing a gap in current literature
- Testable or answerable with available data"
```

## Stage 2: Literature Review

### Elicit — Best for Systematic Literature Reviews

Elicit searches across 200M+ academic papers and extracts key information automatically.

**Key features:**
- Search with natural language questions (not just keywords)
- AI extracts: findings, methods, sample size, limitations
- Compare results across multiple studies in a table
- Identify patterns and contradictions
- Export organized data for your review

**Workflow:**
1. Enter your research question
2. Elicit finds relevant papers
3. AI extracts key data from each paper
4. Review the comparison table
5. Identify themes and gaps
6. Export for your literature review

### Consensus — Find What Science Says

Consensus answers research questions by synthesizing findings from peer-reviewed studies.

**Best for:**
- "Does X cause Y?" questions
- Finding scientific consensus on a topic
- Quick evidence summaries
- Identifying supporting and contradicting studies

**Example:** Search "Does sleep deprivation affect academic performance?" → Consensus shows results from dozens of studies with a synthesis.

### Connected Papers — Visualize Research Landscape

Connected Papers creates a visual graph of related papers, helping you discover research you might have missed.

**How to use it:**
1. Enter a key paper in your field
2. See a visual map of related papers
3. Identify clusters of related research
4. Find seminal papers and recent developments
5. Discover papers that cite your key paper

### Semantic Scholar — AI-Powered Paper Discovery

Semantic Scholar uses AI to understand paper content and recommend relevant research.

**Features:**
- TLDR summaries for papers
- Citation context (how papers reference each other)
- Research feeds based on your interests
- Influence scores for papers
- Free API for programmatic access

### ResearchRabbit — The "Spotify for Papers"

ResearchRabbit learns your research interests and recommends papers, similar to how Spotify recommends music.

**How it works:**
1. Add papers you've already found to a collection
2. AI recommends related papers
3. Visualize connections between papers
4. Get email alerts for new relevant papers
5. Collaborate with co-authors on collections

**Price:** Completely free

## Stage 3: Reading & Understanding Papers

### Scispace — AI Paper Reading Assistant

Scispace helps you understand complex papers by explaining them in simple language.

**Features:**
- Upload any PDF and ask questions about it
- AI explains complex sections in plain English
- Math equation explanations
- Technical term definitions in context
- Cross-reference with related papers
- Highlight and annotate with AI assistance

**Example:**
```
You: "Explain the methodology in section 3 in simple terms"
Scispace: [Plain English explanation of the statistical methods used]

You: "What does equation 4.2 mean?"
Scispace: [Step-by-step breakdown of the equation]
```

### Claude — Best for Long Papers

Claude's 200K token context window means it can process entire papers (or multiple papers) at once.

**Use cases:**
- Upload a full paper and ask for a summary
- Compare methodologies across multiple papers
- Extract specific data points from long documents
- Ask follow-up questions about any section

## Stage 4: Writing Your Paper

### AI-Assisted Writing (The Right Way)

Use AI as a writing assistant, not a ghostwriter. Here's the ethical approach:

**Outlining:**
```
Prompt: "Based on these 5 key findings from my literature review 
[list findings], create a detailed outline for a research paper 
with Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, 
Discussion, and Conclusion sections."
```

**Drafting sections:**
```
Prompt: "I need to write the methodology section. Here are my 
research methods: [describe]. Help me structure this section 
following APA guidelines. Include subsections for participants, 
materials, procedure, and data analysis."
```

**Improving clarity:**
```
Prompt: "Rewrite this paragraph to be more concise and academic 
in tone. Keep the same meaning but improve clarity: [your paragraph]"
```

**Checking arguments:**
```
Prompt: "Review my discussion section. Are there any logical gaps? 
Do my conclusions follow from the data? What counterarguments 
should I address? [your text]"
```

### Scite.ai — Smart Citation Analysis

Scite.ai shows you how papers have been cited — whether they've been supported, contradicted, or just mentioned.

**Why it matters:** Not all citations are equal. A paper cited 100 times might have been contradicted 50 times. Scite helps you understand the real impact.

**Features:**
- Citation statements in context
- Supporting vs. contradicting citations
- Citation reliability scores
- Integration with Zotero

### Zotero + AI Plugins — Citation Management

Zotero is the gold standard for citation management. With AI plugins, it becomes even more powerful.

**Recommended plugins:**
- **Zotero GPT** — ask questions about your library
- **Better BibTeX** — improved citation keys
- **Zotero PDF Translate** — translate papers in real-time
- **Scite Plugin** — see citation context in Zotero

## Stage 5: Editing & Polishing

**Grammar and style:**
- Grammarly (academic tone detection)
- ProWritingAid (academic writing mode)
- ChatGPT ("Edit this for academic tone and APA style")

**Plagiarism check:**
- Turnitin (if your institution provides it)
- Quetext (free alternative)
- Always run a check before submission

**Citation formatting:**
- Zotero auto-generates citations in any style
- ChatGPT can help fix citation formatting issues
- Double-check AI-generated citations (they can be fabricated)

## Complete AI Research Workflow

Here's the full workflow from start to finish:

1. **Explore** → Perplexity (broad research) + ChatGPT (refine questions)
2. **Find papers** → Elicit + Consensus + Semantic Scholar
3. **Discover more** → Connected Papers + ResearchRabbit
4. **Read & understand** → Scispace + Claude
5. **Organize** → Zotero (citations) + Notion (notes)
6. **Write** → ChatGPT/Claude (outlining, drafting assistance)
7. **Cite** → Scite.ai (citation analysis) + Zotero (formatting)
8. **Edit** → Grammarly + ProWritingAid
9. **Check** → Plagiarism checker + manual review

## Academic Integrity Guidelines

1. **Always disclose AI usage** if your institution requires it
2. **Never submit AI-generated text as your own writing**
3. **Verify every citation** — AI can fabricate references
4. **Use AI for assistance, not replacement** — your analysis and arguments should be original
5. **Check your institution's AI policy** — rules vary widely
6. **Keep records** of how you used AI in your research process

The researchers who learn to use these tools effectively will produce better work faster. Just remember: AI is your research assistant, not your co-author.
