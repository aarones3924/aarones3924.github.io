## Content Repurposing Strategy

One piece of content should become many:

```
1 YouTube Video (10 min)
  → 3-5 TikTok/Reels clips (Opus Clip)
  → 1 Blog post (ChatGPT transcription → article)
  → 5 Twitter/X posts (key quotes and insights)
  → 1 LinkedIn article (professional angle)
  → 3 Instagram carousel slides (Canva)
  → 1 Pinterest pin (Canva)
  → 1 Email newsletter (summary + link)
```

This turns 1 video into 15+ pieces of content across 7 platforms.

## Tips for Using AI as a Creator

1. **AI is your assistant, not your replacement** — your personality and perspective are what people subscribe for
2. **Always add your voice** — AI-generated scripts need your personal touch
3. **Use AI for the boring stuff** — captions, descriptions, scheduling, repurposing
4. **Don't over-automate** — audiences can tell when content feels soulless
5. **Experiment constantly** — try new AI tools monthly, keep what works
6. **Disclose when appropriate** — transparency builds trust with your audience

## Bottom Line

AI tools let solo creators produce content at the quality and volume of a full production team. The creators who embrace these tools will outpace those who don't — not because AI makes better content, but because it frees you to make more of the content only you can create.

Start with the free tools, build your workflow, and upgrade as your channel grows. The best investment is your time learning to use these tools effectively.
