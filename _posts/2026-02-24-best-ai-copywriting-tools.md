## Tips for Better AI Copy

1. **Give context** — the more you tell AI about your audience, product, and goals, the better the output
2. **Generate multiple versions** — create 5-10 variations and pick the best
3. **Edit for your voice** — AI gets the structure right; you add the personality
4. **Test everything** — A/B test AI copy against your current copy
5. **Use frameworks** — AIDA, PAS, and BAB give AI clear structure to follow
6. **Include specifics** — numbers, testimonials, and concrete details beat vague claims
